The recent expansion of social networking leads to an analytic interest that intends to extrat certain conclussions about the way that human beings communicate with each other on the Internet.

In this project we will design and develop an integral and adaptative system to extract data from Twitter using the REST API provided by this company. This system will offer users the ability to delimit the relevant data, extract it and store it in order to obtain different kinds of analysis and reports that lead them to the answers that they were looking for.

The main identitary feautres of our system will be high versatility, easily scalable, easy to use \& result comprehension and high integrability. 

As an example, we will test our system in the context of citizen participation in the city of Madrid (across the platform Decide Madrid).
